# Project Summary
The project is focused on developing a web-based CAN-BUS simulation system that allows vehicle manufacturers and developers to emulate CAN-BUS communication without physical hardware. It provides tools for simulating, analyzing, and managing CAN messages, facilitating event detection, calibration, and data storage through an intuitive web interface.

# Project Module Description
The project comprises several functional modules:
1. **CAN Simulator Engine**: Simulates CAN-BUS traffic.
2. **CAN Sniffer & Filter**: Monitors and captures CAN bus traffic.
3. **Calibration Controller**: Detects triggered events based on user actions.
4. **Label Manager**: Associates CAN messages with meaningful labels.
5. **Database Layer**: Manages vehicle and CAN message data.
6. **Playback Engine**: Replays stored messages to the simulated bus.
7. **Web UI**: Provides an interactive interface for users.
